?Wonderings, pondering, desgign decisions?
Should constructors just set vftable pointer to super's vftable or should the super's vftable be memcpy'ed into the dervied pointer?

Leaning towards memcpy

Reason:
No point in just setting the pointer if the pointer is just going to be overwritten...

Inefficient setting of variables in vtable, but necessary to call once. Easier to design, less code though...
